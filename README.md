# Loocatr-frontend
### Synopsis
Our number 1 priority is your number 2

Loocatr is a mobile application that lets users find the nearest bathroom while on the go. The app integrates Yelp's API and provides ratings, reviews, pictures, and accessibility information allowing users to find a bathroom that fits their needs.

## Inspiration

Loocatr was created for users who need to use the restroom often, especially in big cities where clean public restrooms are difficult to find. Loocatr is also a way for people with illnesses such as Crohn's disease to feel a little less constrained, and to help them move through the city without the fear of not being near a bathroom they can use.

## Tech Stack

The stack used for this project is React Native for the front-end, and a Ruby on Rails API for the backend.
